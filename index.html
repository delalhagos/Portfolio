            I have worked as an Office Administrator Assistant at the Ministry
            of Attorney General (MAG) as a Summer Experience Student Employee.
            Through my time at MAG I have become familiar with how different
            ministries function and specifically court services and sheriff
            offices. As part of my position, I processed different applications
            such as subpoenas, hagues, writs and others. I also had experience
            working with clients and assisting them with filing the applications
            and following up to book appointments and explaining the process and
            how the application works. Through this position I was able to
            explore databases and software such as MS Access, Writ, Outlook, and
            other internal applications.
          </p>

            I have worked as project Coordinator at BAM- Books, Art and Music
            which is a start-up that engage youth to participate in civics
            through different Art programs and workshops. I led the national
            team for BAM- Books, Arts and Music to host their first ever Mental
            Health Conference bridging the gap between newcomer, refugee, and
            indigenous communities. My role consisted of recruiting and managing
            volunteers, setting up outreach strategies, establishing
            partnerships, and evaluating strategies. This position allowed me to
            use my MS office, Google Drive and Adobe skills and to further
            expand my knowledge in using these programs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have also worked as a Curator and junior researcher in different
            organizations such as The Ward Museum and Pivot 2020. During my time
            as a curator and junior researcher at the Ward Museum, I have worked
            with stakeholders and underserved communities to highlight the
            importance of migrations stories and storytellers by developing
            lifelong partnerships within communities and organizations. As a
            researcher with Pivot 2020 I was able to work with youth from all
            around Canada to compile information and resources to study and
            create a pilot program on the impact of COVID-19 on youth employment
            throughout Canada. These research positions allowed me to gain
            experiences working on different databases and software such as
            GRID, Google drive, Canva and Outlook.

            enriched my hard and soft skills such as communication skills,

            determination, and commitment to succeed will allow me to thrive in
